**[2. Customer booking prediction](https://github.com/ElenaHrytsai/Customer-booking-prediction)**

This project focused on creating a predictive model using Random Forest classifier.
The prediction model determines whether a client will complete a booking or leave the website.
Additionally, the significance of each feature has been assessed to determine which one has the most significant impact on the target variable.
