This project focused on creating a predictive model using Random Forest classifier. The prediction model determines whether a client will complete a booking or leave the website.
Additionally, the significance of each feature has been assessed to determine which one has the most significant impact on the target variable.

**[3. Belgium Traffic Signs Classification](https://github.com/ElenaHrytsai/Belgian-Traffic-Dataset/blob/main/belgiumTSC.ipynb)**
